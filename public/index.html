                    <p class="block-title">DevOps Project</p>
                    <p>During the current semester of my course, we, as a group, developed and deployed an IoT 
                        environment centered around scanners. These scanners communicated with an MQTT broker, 
                        which interfaced with a custom Pub/Sub system we built using Python. The data was then transmitted through 
                        Apache Kafka to Prometheus for metrics storage and monitoring, and subsequently visualized using Grafana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first release, we utilized KinD (Kubernetes in Docker) to create virtual machines for both test and 
                        staging environments, allowing us to simulate real-world deployment scenarios. To ensure high availability (HA), 
                        we implemented StatefulSets, providing resilience and stability to our services. Additionally, we set up a CI/CD 
                        pipeline using Argo CD, automating the deployment process from development to production, ensuring efficient and 
                        reliable delivery of new updates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the technical implementation, we used Jira for project management, where we tracked tasks, progress, 
                        and sprints to ensure smooth development. For documentation, we leveraged Confluence to maintain detailed records of 
                        system architecture, design decisions, and deployment processes. Communication within the team was facilitated through 
                        Slack, allowing for quick updates, collaboration, and issue resolution in real time.

                    <p class="block-title">GitLab Repositories</p>
                    <p>Throughout the years, I have worked on a variety of projects showcased in my GitLab repositories, 
                        ranging from DevOps to software development. One notable project is Wavdio, a music player application that 
                        allows users to upload and play music through a browser-based GUI. This project involved Docker, Python, CSS, 
                        and Jinja, and was later deployed using Kubernetes for scalability and microservices architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I have completed several academic and practical projects in algorithms and data structures, including complex assignments 
                        and coding challenges in Java, which strengthened my understanding of computational theory and software design. 
                        Another important repository is the Own Website project, where I developed and deployed this personal website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a pipeline. 
                        This site is hosted on Azure DNS services, serving as a portfolio for my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These projects, along with others involving scripting, automation, containerization and deployment, 
                        reflect my progression in DevOps practices, cloud environments, and full-stack development.
